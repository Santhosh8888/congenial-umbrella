This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to accurately classify different types of garbage into categories such as plastic, glass, metal, paper, and organic waste. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of waste management and recycling processes by automating the sorting of waste materials.

Key Components:

Data Collection: A dataset comprising images of various garbage types is collected. The dataset includes labeled images to train and test the model.

Data Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed to ensure they are suitable for model training. This includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data.

Model Selection: A deep learning architecture, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is chosen for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

Training the Model: The preprocessed images are fed into the CNN, and the model is trained using supervised learning techniques. The model learns to identify distinguishing features of each garbage category.

Evaluation and Optimization: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

Deployment: The trained model is deployed in a real-world setting, such as an automated sorting system in a recycling facility. It classifies incoming waste items in real-time, enabling efficient sorting and recycling.

Continuous Improvement: The model is continuously updated with new data to improve its accuracy and adapt to any changes in the types of waste being processed.

Impact:

Implementing deep learning for garbage classification significantly enhances the accuracy and speed of waste sorting, leading to better recycling rates and reduced environmental impact. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in advancing sustainable waste management practices.
